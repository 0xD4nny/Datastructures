<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a collection of custom data structures implemented in C#. It was originally created as a way to deepen my understanding of core programming concepts, particularly memory management, data organization, and algorithm efficiency.</p>

<p>As part of my learning journey, I developed a <strong>Custom Linked List</strong> and a <strong>Custom List</strong>, both designed to mimic and improve upon built-in .NET functionality. Later, while working on a <strong>Custom Log File (CLF) simulation</strong>, I recognized the need for more advanced data structures. This led me to explore and implement various trees, including <strong>Binary Trees</strong>, <strong>Binary Search Trees</strong>, and ultimately, a <strong>Red-Black Tree (RBT)</strong>.</p>

<h2>Implemented Data Structures</h2>
<h3>List Structures</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CustomLinkedList.cs</strong> – A linked list with efficient insert and delete operations.</li>
    <li><strong>CustomList.cs</strong> – A dynamically resizing list optimized for memory usage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tree Structures</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>BinaryTree.cs</strong> – A foundational tree structure for hierarchical data representation.</li>
    <li><strong>BinarySearchTree.cs</strong> – A BST optimized for fast searching and sorting.</li>
    <li><strong>RedBlackTree.cs</strong> – A self-balancing binary search tree ensuring O(log n) efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CustomExceptions.cs</strong> – Custom error handling for better debugging.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>Through this project, I have gained valuable insights into:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Memory allocation and its impact on performance.</li>
    <li>Tree balancing techniques for optimized searching and insertion.</li>
    <li>Analyzing professional .NET implementations to learn best practices.</li>
    <li>Applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles effectively.</li>
    <li>Improving debugging skills by handling edge cases efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
<p>Although this project is no longer under active development, I plan to enhance it by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Adding comprehensive unit tests for validation.</li>
    <li>Optimizing memory usage for greater efficiency.</li>
    <li>Implementing additional structures such as AVL Trees.</li>
    <li>Expanding the repository with further learning-oriented implementations.</li>
    <li>Providing detailed documentation and real-world usage examples.</li>
    <li>Benchmarking performance against built-in .NET collections.</li>
</ul>
