<h1>Custom Data Structures in C#</h1>  
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a collection of custom data structures implemented in C#, created as part of my exploration into memory management, data organization, and algorithm efficiency.</p>
<p>What began as an experiment with linked lists and dynamic arrays soon expanded into a deeper investigation of read/write operations, performance trade-offs, and tree balancing.</p>
<p>As my understanding grew, I implemented more complex structures, including Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and a Red-Black Tree (RBT).</p>
<p>The attached image visually represents this learning journey, highlighting key comparisons and optimizations explored throughout the process.</p>
